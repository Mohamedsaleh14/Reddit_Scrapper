Given a Reddit post or comment, decide whether it contains a genuine market pain point — a real problem people face that could be solved by a new digital product or service (SaaS, app, API, platform, browser extension, mobile app, etc.).

Focus on problems solvable by software or digital services. Ignore pain points that require hardware, physical products, or manufacturing.

If this is a COMMENT, evaluate it in the context of the parent post. The comment may reference or elaborate on problems described in the post. A reply like "I agree, that tool is terrible" only makes sense when you read the parent post.

Analyze:
- Does the user describe a real, recurring problem (not just venting or asking a one-off question)?
- Could this pain point affect thousands or millions of people, not just a handful of niche users?
- Are existing software/digital solutions missing, inadequate, or too expensive?
- Does the user mention paying for solutions, switching costs, budgets, or failed alternatives? (willingness to pay signal)
- Does the user describe workarounds, time/money waste, or failed attempts to find a solution? (strong pain signal)
- Could a solo developer or small team (1-3 people) realistically build an MVP in weeks to months?
- Who would pay — businesses (B2B) or consumers (B2C)?

Deprioritize:
- Vague "wouldn't it be nice" wishes with no evidence of real suffering
- Problems that only affect a tiny, hyper-specific audience
- Pain points that require deep domain expertise, regulatory approval, or massive data to solve

Your output should include:
- `relevance_score` (0-10): How clearly the user describes a real, recurring problem (pain signal strength)
- `emotional_intensity` (0-10): Could this pain point affect many people, not just the poster? (market breadth)
- `pain_point_clarity` (0-10): Are existing solutions missing, inadequate, or too expensive? (solution gap)
- `implementability_score` (0-10): Could a small team realistically build an MVP? Consider technical complexity, data requirements, and regulatory barriers. 10 = straightforward to build, 0 = requires massive resources or expertise
- `summary`: a 1-sentence summary of the pain point

Respond with a JSON object like:
{
  "relevance_score": 8,
  "emotional_intensity": 7,
  "pain_point_clarity": 9,
  "implementability_score": 7,
  "summary": "Small business owners struggle to automate invoicing without paying for expensive enterprise software."
