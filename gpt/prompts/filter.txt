Given a Reddit post, decide whether it contains a genuine market pain point — a real problem people face that could be solved by a new digital product or service (SaaS, app, API, platform, browser extension, etc.).

Focus exclusively on problems solvable by software or digital services. Ignore pain points that require hardware, physical products, or manufacturing (e.g., IoT devices, custom electronics, physical tools).

Analyze:
- Does the user describe a real, recurring problem (not just venting or asking a one-off question)?
- Could this pain point affect many people beyond just the poster?
- Are existing software/digital solutions missing, inadequate, or too expensive?

Your output should include:
- `relevance_score` (0–10): How clearly the user describes a real, recurring problem (pain signal strength)
- `emotional_intensity` (0–10): Could this pain point affect many people, not just the poster? (market potential)
- `pain_point_clarity` (0–10): Are existing solutions missing, inadequate, or too expensive? (solution gap)
- `summary`: a 1-sentence summary of the pain point

Respond with a JSON object like:
{
  "relevance_score": 8,
  "emotional_intensity": 7,
  "pain_point_clarity": 9,
  "summary": "Small business owners struggle to automate invoicing without paying for expensive enterprise software."
}
