Given a Reddit post or comment, decide whether it contains a genuine market pain point — a real problem people face that could be solved by a new digital product or service (SaaS, app, API, platform, browser extension, mobile app, etc.).

Focus on problems solvable by software or digital services. Ignore pain points that require hardware, physical products, or manufacturing.

If this is a COMMENT, evaluate it in the context of the parent post. The comment may reference or elaborate on problems described in the post. A reply like "I agree, that tool is terrible" only makes sense when you read the parent post.

Analyze:
- Does the user describe a real, recurring problem (not just venting or asking a one-off question)?
- Could this pain point affect thousands or millions of people, not just a handful of niche users?
- Are existing software/digital solutions missing, inadequate, or too expensive?
- Does the user mention paying for solutions, switching costs, budgets, or failed alternatives? (willingness to pay signal)
- Does the user describe workarounds, time/money waste, or failed attempts to find a solution? (strong pain signal)
- Could a solo developer or small team (1-3 people) realistically build an MVP in weeks to months?
- Who would pay — businesses (B2B) or consumers (B2C)?

Deprioritize:
- Vague "wouldn't it be nice" wishes with no evidence of real suffering
- Problems that only affect a tiny, hyper-specific audience
- Pain points that require deep domain expertise, regulatory approval, or massive data to solve

Your output should include:
- `relevance_score` (0-10): How clearly the user describes a real, recurring problem (pain signal strength)
  - 0 = no real problem, just idle curiosity or hypothetical musing
  - 3 = vague complaint with no evidence it recurs or affects others
  - 5 = clear problem described, but unclear how often it happens or how many people share it
  - 7 = recurring problem with specific details (frequency, failed attempts, workarounds mentioned)
  - 10 = urgent, well-documented recurring pain with concrete evidence (metrics, multiple users confirming, money spent)
- `emotional_intensity` (0-10): Could this pain point affect many people, not just the poster? (market breadth)
  - 0 = affects only this one person in a unique situation
  - 3 = niche group (fewer than ~1K people likely affected)
  - 5 = moderate audience (thousands of people in a recognizable segment)
  - 7 = large segment (tens of thousands — e.g., all freelance accountants, all Shopify store owners)
  - 10 = widespread problem affecting millions (e.g., all remote workers, all small business owners)
- `pain_point_clarity` (0-10): Are existing solutions missing, inadequate, or too expensive? (solution gap)
  - 0 = existing solutions fully address the problem at a reasonable price
  - 3 = solutions exist but are mildly inconvenient or slightly overpriced
  - 5 = solutions are too expensive, too complex, or missing one key feature
  - 7 = major gaps — users resorting to manual workarounds, spreadsheets, or duct-tape integrations
  - 10 = no viable solution exists; significant time or money wasted on the problem regularly
- `implementability_score` (0-10): Could a small team realistically build an MVP? Consider technical complexity, data requirements, and regulatory barriers. 10 = straightforward to build, 0 = requires massive resources or expertise
  - 0 = requires massive infrastructure, regulatory approval, or domain-specific breakthroughs
  - 3 = needs specialized ML/data pipelines, rare domain expertise, or complex partnerships
  - 5 = moderate complexity — some integrations, moderate data needs, or niche technical skills
  - 7 = standard web/mobile app leveraging existing APIs and services; one dev can build it
  - 10 = simple CRUD app or browser extension; a solo dev can ship an MVP in weeks
- `summary`: a 1-sentence summary of the pain point

Respond with a JSON object like:
{
  "relevance_score": 8,
  "emotional_intensity": 7,
  "pain_point_clarity": 9,
  "implementability_score": 7,
  "summary": "Small business owners struggle to automate invoicing without paying for expensive enterprise software."
