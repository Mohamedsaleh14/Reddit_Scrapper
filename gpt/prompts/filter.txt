Given a Reddit post or comment, decide whether it contains a genuine market pain point — a real problem people face that could be solved by a new digital product or service (SaaS, app, API, platform, browser extension, mobile app, etc.).

Focus on problems solvable by software or digital services. Ignore pain points that require hardware, physical products, or manufacturing.

If this is a COMMENT, evaluate it in the context of the parent post. The comment may reference or elaborate on problems described in the post. A reply like "I agree, that tool is terrible" only makes sense when you read the parent post.

Analyze:
- Does the user describe a real, recurring problem (not just venting or asking a one-off question)?
- Could this pain point affect thousands or millions of people, not just a handful of niche users?
- Are existing software/digital solutions missing, inadequate, or too expensive?
- Does the user mention paying for solutions, switching costs, budgets, or failed alternatives? (willingness to pay signal)
- Does the user describe workarounds, time/money waste, or failed attempts to find a solution? (strong pain signal)
- Could a solo developer or small team (1-3 people) realistically build an MVP in weeks to months?
- Who would pay — businesses (B2B) or consumers (B2C)?
- Could this become a platform with network effects, viral growth, or a broad user base (millions, not thousands)?

Deprioritize:
- Vague "wouldn't it be nice" wishes with no evidence of real suffering
- Problems that only affect a tiny, hyper-specific audience
- Pain points that require deep domain expertise, regulatory approval, or massive data to solve
- Ideas that are trivially simple to build (basic CRUD, simple wrappers, landing pages, browser extensions with one function). If any decent developer can vibe-code it in a day or a week with AI tools, it has ZERO defensibility and is NOT worth pursuing. We want problems that require real system architecture, complex integrations, or deep technical work — things that take months of serious implementation to get right.

Exclude entirely (score 0 across the board):
- Legal services, law firm tools, attorney/paralegal workflows
- Government policy, lobbying, regulatory compliance tools
- Overseas contracts, supplier management, import/export logistics
- Importing, exporting, freight forwarding, customs brokerage
- Insurance products, claims management, liability assessment tools
- Narrow industry-specific tools for a single vertical (e.g., "dental office scheduler", "trucking fleet manager") — unless the underlying problem is universal

Vision — what we're looking for:
We want **universal, consumer-scale or prosumer product ideas** that can gain massive traction. Think platform plays with network effects, tools that could attract millions of users, and products that solve broad human problems — not narrow industry verticals.
Caliber of ideas we're after: Tinder (dating → platform), Airbnb (lodging → marketplace), n8n (automation → prosumer platform), Flo Health (period tracking → health platform). The common thread: they start with a universal pain point and grow into platforms with defensible network effects or data moats.
If the idea only serves a niche of <10K potential users, it's not what we're looking for.

Your output should include:
- `relevance_score` (0-10): How clearly the user describes a real, recurring problem (pain signal strength)
  - 0 = no real problem, just idle curiosity or hypothetical musing
  - 3 = vague complaint with no evidence it recurs or affects others
  - 5 = clear problem described, but unclear how often it happens or how many people share it
  - 7 = recurring problem with specific details (frequency, failed attempts, workarounds mentioned)
  - 10 = urgent, well-documented recurring pain with concrete evidence (metrics, multiple users confirming, money spent)
- `emotional_intensity` (0-10): Could this pain point affect many people, not just the poster? (market breadth)
  - 0 = affects only this one person in a unique situation
  - 3 = niche group (fewer than ~1K people likely affected)
  - 5 = moderate audience (thousands of people in a recognizable segment)
  - 7 = large segment (tens of thousands — e.g., all freelance accountants, all Shopify store owners)
  - 10 = widespread problem affecting millions (e.g., all remote workers, all small business owners)
- `pain_point_clarity` (0-10): Are existing solutions missing, inadequate, or too expensive? (solution gap)
  - 0 = existing solutions fully address the problem at a reasonable price
  - 3 = solutions exist but are mildly inconvenient or slightly overpriced
  - 5 = solutions are too expensive, too complex, or missing one key feature
  - 7 = major gaps — users resorting to manual workarounds, spreadsheets, or duct-tape integrations
  - 10 = no viable solution exists; significant time or money wasted on the problem regularly
- `implementability_score` (0-10): Could a small team (1-5 people) realistically build an MVP? Higher = more feasible for a small team.
  - 0 = requires massive infrastructure, regulatory approval, or domain-specific breakthroughs
  - 3 = needs specialized ML/data pipelines, rare domain expertise, or complex partnerships
  - 5 = moderate complexity — some integrations, moderate data needs, or niche technical skills
  - 7 = achievable with strong engineers in 2-6 months; requires real architecture but no moonshots
  - 10 = well within reach of a focused small team using existing APIs and services
- `technical_depth_score` (0-10): Does this idea require real engineering, system design, and architectural thinking — or can any beginner clone it in a day with an AI coding assistant?
  - 0 = a simple form/CRUD app, landing page, or single-API wrapper — no real engineering needed, pure vibe-code territory
  - 3 = basic web app with standard auth, payments, and a database — a weekend hackathon project
  - 5 = needs meaningful backend logic, multiple integrations, or data processing — takes weeks of real work
  - 7 = requires careful system architecture: queues, caching, real-time processing, complex data models, or multi-service orchestration
  - 10 = deep technical work: distributed systems, custom algorithms, complex state machines, ML pipelines, or protocol-level engineering
  NOTE: We want ideas scoring 5-10. Anything below 4 is too easy to build and has no technical moat — competitors can replicate it instantly.
