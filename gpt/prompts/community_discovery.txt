Based on the following top-performing Reddit posts (titles and summaries), recommend a ranked list of 12 adjacent subreddits that are likely rich in product-worthy pain points and unmet needs.

{SUMMARIES}

IMPORTANT: Cast a WIDE net across wildly different domains. Do NOT cluster around tech/startup/developer communities. People spend money to solve problems in every area of life.

Aim for this mix:
- ~4 tech/startup/developer communities (tools, infrastructure, workflows)
- ~4 consumer/lifestyle communities (parenting, health, personal finance, fitness, food, pets, hobbies)
- ~4 niche/unexpected communities (trades, aging/eldercare, legal, real estate, education, specific health conditions, local services)

Look for communities where people:
- Spend money to solve problems or express frustration with existing paid solutions
- Describe workarounds, time waste, or failed attempts to find tools
- Discuss recurring operational pain (not just one-off questions)
- Have high engagement around "how do you handle X?" or "is there a tool for Y?" threads

For each recommended subreddit, provide:
- A short rationale explaining WHY this community has product opportunities
- An estimate of:
  - % of posts with pain point signals
  - % of comments asking for solutions
  - Engagement level (low, medium, high)

Only include subreddits that:
- Have active discussions about problems, workflows, or tool frustrations
- Are active in the past month
- Are not already on the main tracked list

Respond in this format:
[
  {
    "subreddit": "smallbusiness",
    "reason": "Owners frequently discuss operational pain points and seek affordable tool recommendations.",
    "pain_signal_pct": 55,
    "solution_requests_pct": 45,
    "engagement_level": "high"
  },
